## Title : Climate Change vs Global Warming

## Main Question

1) Difference between Climate Change and Global Warming 

## Description
While often used interchangeably, global warming and climate change refer to distinct phenomena. Global warming is specifically the rise in the Earth's average surface temperature due to human-made greenhouse gas emissions. This process is primarily driven by the release of carbon dioxide and other pollutants from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial activities, leading to a gradual increase in global temperatures.

In contrast, climate change encompasses a broader range of long-term changes in the Earthâ€™s climate. It includes not only the warming of the planet but also alterations in weather patterns, precipitation, and wind currents. Beyond temperature increases, climate change manifests in various ways, such as shifting seasonal patterns, more frequent and severe extreme weather events, and changes in ecosystems and wildlife habitats.

For instance, reductions in the amount of snow and ice, rising sea levels, and the loss of sea ice are significant indicators of climate change. These changes impact natural and human systems, leading to consequences like more intense hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves, which can disrupt agriculture, water supply, and health.

Understanding the differences between these terms is crucial for addressing the full scope of environmental challenges. While global warming is a significant driver, climate change reflects the wide-ranging effects on our planet, necessitating comprehensive strategies for mitigation and adaptation.
